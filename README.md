# Notebook for RAG with LangChain Docs

This notebook is for me to learn and experiment with LangChain for creating a retrieval-based question-answering system. It includes the setup of necessary dependencies, environment variables, and the LangChain components for document retrieval and response generation.

## Setup

To install the required dependencies, run the following commands:

```bash
pip install -U langchain langsmith langchainhub langchain_benchmarks
pip install chromadb openai huggingface pandas langchain_experimental sentence_transformers pyarrow anthropic tiktoken
```
